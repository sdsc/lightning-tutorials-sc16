This program uses openCV and python to detect faces in a webcam.
These routines are standard for extracting faces from many large data collections, or video streams, or for many other big data situations.

To run program:

    python face_and_eyes.py

Put your face in front of the webcam, or draw a picture and see if you can fake out the detector.
