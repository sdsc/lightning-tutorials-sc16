Researchers, professionals, and students in higher education participate in a wide range of workshops, institutes, degrees, and certificate programs. For more information, visit http://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/index.html\r\n\r\n## Tutorials\r\n\r\n### Multi-threaded and out-of-core programming in Python\r\n\r\nJupyter Notebooks (for Python 3) that introduce the usage of [`dask`](http://dask.pydata.org) for processing\r\ndata larger than the memory available (out-of-core computing), dependancy resolution with `dask` graphs and\r\nmanipulation of numpy-style arrays with multipole cores (multi-threading).\r\n\r\n### Face detection with OpenCV\r\n\r\nPython 2 demo software using the Computer Vision library `OpenCV` to detect faces in images, the folder contains\r\nalso a version of the demo using a webcam connected to the Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\n### KMeans clustering of weather data\r\n\r\nJupyter Notebooks (for Python 3) that load weather data in `CSV` format with `pandas`, compute statistics, generates plots and computes KMeans clustering with `scikit-learn`.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n",
