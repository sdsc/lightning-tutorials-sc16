# San Diego Supercomputer Center Lightning tutorials @ Supercomputing 2016

This repository contains teaching material for 15 minutes tutorials on Raspberry Pi 3 for 
the San Diego Supercomputer Center booth at Supercomputing 2016 in Salt Lake City.

## Tutorials

1) Multi-threaded and out-of-core programming in Python

Jupyter Notebooks (for Python 3) that introduce the usage of [`dask`](http://dask.pydata.org) for processing
data larger than the memory available (out-of-core computing), dependancy resolution with `dask` graphs and
manipulation of numpy-style arrays with multipole cores (multi-threading).

2) Face detection with OpenCV

Python 2 demo software using the Computer Vision library `OpenCV` to detect faces in images, the folder contains
also a version of the demo using a webcam connected to the Raspberry Pi.
